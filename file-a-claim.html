            <p>Car accidents are stressful, and the last thing you want to worry about is a complicated insurance claim. But knowing the right steps to take can make the process much smoother and help ensure you get the compensation you deserve. This guide will walk you through the entire process, from the scene of the accident to the final settlement.</p>

            <h2>Step 1: At the Scene of the Accident - Safety First!</h2>
            <p>Your immediate priority is safety. Before you even think about insurance, do the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Check for Injuries:</strong> Check on yourself, your passengers, and the people in the other vehicle. Call 911 immediately if anyone is hurt.</li>
                <li><strong>Move to Safety:</strong> If the accident is minor and the cars are drivable, move them to the side of the road to avoid further incidents. Turn on your hazard lights.</li>
                <li><strong>Call the Police:</strong> Even for minor accidents, a police report is an invaluable official document for your insurance claim.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Step 2: Document Everything (Your Phone is Your Best Tool)</h2>
            <p>While waiting for the police, gather as much information as possible. Do not admit fault to anyone.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Exchange Information:</strong> Get the other driver's name, address, phone number, license plate number, driver's license number, and their insurance company and policy number.</li>
                <li><strong>Take Photos:</strong> Photograph everything. The damage to both cars from multiple angles, the license plates, the overall scene, any skid marks, and relevant road signs.</li>
                <li><strong>Get Witness Information:</strong> If there are any witnesses, ask for their names and phone numbers. Their account can be very helpful.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Step 3: Contact Your Insurance Company Promptly</h2>
            <p>You should notify your insurance company as soon as you are able, even if the accident wasn't your fault. Most insurers have a 24/7 claims hotline or a mobile app to start the process.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Have Your Policy Number Ready:</strong> This will speed up the call.</li>
                <li><strong>Provide the Facts:</strong> Stick to the facts you gathered. Do not speculate or guess. Tell them where and when the accident occurred and provide the other driver's information.</li>
                <li><strong>You will be assigned a Claims Adjuster:</strong> This person will be your main point of contact. They will investigate the accident and determine the settlement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Step 4: The Claims Process - What to Expect</h2>
            <p>After you file, the adjuster will guide you. The process typically involves:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Damage Assessment:</strong> The adjuster will ask you to get repair estimates from approved body shops or may send someone to inspect the vehicle's damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Determining Fault:</strong> The adjuster will use the police report, driver statements, and evidence to determine who was at fault.</li>
                <li><strong>Settlement Offer:</strong> Once the investigation is complete, the insurance company will make a settlement offer to cover the repairs or, if the car is a total loss, its Actual Cash Value (ACV).</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Pro Tip: Keep a "Claims Folder"</h3>
            <p>Keep all your documents—the police report number, photos, receipts for a rental car, the adjuster's contact info, and notes from every phone call—in one place. This organization will be your best friend during a complex claim.</p>
