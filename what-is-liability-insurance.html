<p>If you're new to car insurance in the USA, the term 'liability insurance' is one you'll hear the most. It's the most basic, and often legally required, type of coverage. But what does it actually do?</p>

<h2>What Liability Insurance Covers</h2>
<p>Simply put, liability insurance pays for the *other person's* expenses if you are at fault in an accident. It does NOT cover your own car or your own injuries. It is split into two main parts:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bodily Injury Liability (BI):</strong> This covers the other person's medical bills, lost wages, and pain and suffering.</li>
    <li><strong>Property Damage Liability (PD):</strong> This covers the cost to repair or replace the other person's car or any other property you damaged, like a fence or a mailbox.</li>
</ul>
