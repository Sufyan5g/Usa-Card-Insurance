                <p>Choosing car insurance is a balancing act. You want enough coverage to be fully protected in a serious accident, but you don't want to pay for more than you need. This guide will help you find that perfect balance.</p>
                
                <!-- H2 Tag: Topic ko alag-alag sections mein baantein -->
                <h2>Step 1: Understand Your State's Minimum Requirements</h2>
                <p>Every state (except New Hampshire) legally requires you to have at least a minimum amount of liability insurance. This is usually expressed in three numbers, like 25/50/25.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>$25,000</strong> for bodily injury liability for one person.</li>
                    <li><strong>$50,000</strong> for bodily injury liability for all people in one accident.</li>
                    <li><strong>$25,000</strong> for property damage liability for one accident.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Warning:</strong> The state minimum is almost NEVER enough. A new car costs more than $25,000, and serious medical bills can easily exceed $50,000. Relying only on the minimum is a huge financial risk.</p>

                <h2>Step 2: A Smarter Liability Coverage (The 100/300/100 Rule)</h2>
                <p>For most drivers, a much safer and highly recommended level of coverage is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>$100,000</strong> in bodily injury liability per person.</li>
                    <li><strong>$300,000</strong> in bodily injury liability per accident.</li>
                    <li><strong>$100,000</strong> in property damage liability per accident.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This provides solid protection for the vast majority of accidents without breaking the bank.</p>
                
                <h2>Step 3: Do You Need to Protect Your Own Car?</h2>
                <p>Liability only covers the *other* driver. To protect your own car, you need these two coverages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Collision Coverage:</strong> Pays to repair your car after an accident, no matter who is at fault.</li>
                    <li><strong>Comprehensive Coverage:</strong> Pays for damage from non-accident events like theft, fire, hail, or hitting a deer.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> If your car is worth more than $4,000 or if you can't afford to replace it out of pocket, you should have collision and comprehensive coverage.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion: Your Final Checklist</h2>
                <p>For a typical driver, a strong, well-rounded policy looks like this:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Liability Coverage of 100/300/100.</li>
                    <li>Collision and Comprehensive coverage (if your car is not very old).</li>
                    <li>Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Coverage (highly recommended).</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Start with these numbers when you get quotes, and you'll be on the right path to being properly insured.</p>
